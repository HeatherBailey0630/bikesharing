## Overview
This project uses tableau to create visualizations from a csv file containing NYC CitiBike data. We analyzed the information and created the following summary and visualizations.

## Results

### August Peak Hours

As we view the August peak hours, we can conclude the following:
1. The most common times customers rent bikes are 5PM and 6PM, likely for commute.
2. The least common times for bike rentals are between 12AM and 5AM.

### Trips by Gender

Here we break down the trips by gender and can see a pattern. The busiest times of day are from 6AM - 9AM, and again from 5PM - 7PM. One can infer that the bikes are most frequently rented during commuter hours. The least busy day is Wednesday for bike rentals, and males rent bikes more frequently than females.

### Trips by Weekday Per Hour

Here, again we see the times of the day with the highest and lowest bike rental activity. On weekdays, bikes are most frequently rented during commuter hours (6AM-9AM and again from 5PM-7PM), with the exception of Wednesday afternoons. On weekends, bikes are most frequently rented throughout the middle of the day (between 10AM and 5PM).

### Trips by Gender by Weekday

With this breakdown of gender by weekday, there are a few key takeaways. There are significantly more male subscribers than female subscribers, there are significantly more male subscribers than male customers, and Thursday and Friday appear to be the busiest days for bike rentals.

### Checkout Times by Gender

As we view the tripduration by gender, we can see another clear pattern.
1. The most common trip duration is 5 minutes, which is extremely short. So the majority of customers are renting bikes for around 5 minutes at a time. 
2. Not many customers are renting bikes from the 1 - 2 hour range.
3. The majority of bike rentals are between 2 and 12 minutes.

### Top Starting Locations

In our top starting locations visualization, we can see the bigger and darker the dot, the more frequently that location is used. One of the most frequently utilized rental sites is outside of Madison Sqaure Garden and Penn Station (latitude: 40.7519, longitude: -73.9777)

### Top Ending Locations

Similar to our top starting locations map, here we visualize our top ending locations. Our most frequently utilized sites are the same as our top starting locations, so it appears most people return the bikes back to the same place they rented them from.

## Summary

From our visualizations created in Tableau, we came to a few conclusions:
1. The most common times customers rent bikes are on weekdays between 6AM - 9AM, and again from 5PM - 7PM, and on weekends between 10AM and 5PM, likely due to people utilizing citibikes as an alternate means of public transport on their daily commute to and from work, and on weekends for leisure activities. 
2. Males utilize citibikes at a much higher rate than females, and also make up the majority of the subscriber population. 
3. The top starting locations for bike rentals are in the inner city, and around train stations and parks. The ending locations are similar, inferring that most bikes are returned to the same location they were originally rented at. 
4. Some additional visualizations we could create to help us better understand trends would be to analyze the data in the colder months, to compare with the August data. We could also analyze the average trip duration and number of rides for subscribers vs customers.
